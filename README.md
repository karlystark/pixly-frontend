# Pix.ly

Pix.ly is a photo gallery app that allows users to upload photos to their pix.ly board, view metadata, (including the camera used and location), contribute custom alt-text for their photos (and learn how to effectively write it!), and download photos. Future implementations will include search functionality, focusing on metadata search. 

## Stack
Pix.ly's frontend was built using React.js and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Pix.ly's backend and API were built using Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3 for photo storage.

## Collaboration
Pix.ly's initial full-stack framework was built in collaboration with Kirra Hyde in Rithm32 :)
