# Pix.ly

Pix.ly allows users to upload photos to their pix.ly board and view metadata about those photos (including the camera used and location). Users also contribute custom alt-text for their images. Future implementations will include light photo editing capabilities and searching by metadata and tags. 

## Stack
Pix.ly's frontend was built using React.js and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Collaboration
Pix.ly's initial full-stack framework was built in collaboration with Kirra Hyde in Rithm32 :) 

## Demo (as of 10/2023)
