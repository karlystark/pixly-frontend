# Pix.ly

Pix.ly allows users to upload photos to their pix.ly board and view metadata about those photos (including the camera used and location). Future implementations will include light photo editing capabilities, searching by metadata and tags, and user-contribution alt text for accessibility. 

## Stack
Pix.ly's frontend was built using React.js and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Collaboration
Pix.ly's initial full-stack framework was built in collaboration with Kirra Hyde in Rithm32 :) 

## Demo (as of 10/2023)
